# guess_where_project
please read the postmasn description i wrote a lot of important information there.
so all that there is left to do as for me is to add leader boards and get image links.
as far as hosting images i used the cloudinary api, i send the image to whatever format i want and it gets stored as a link.

i used 2 schemas so far, one for the users and one for the images. the images json details (long,lat) will be stored in the mongodb, however the link will be stored in the cloudinary api.

i am planing to add a new schema for the leaderboards, and figure out how to get data back.


please click on the postman link to test the api server:-
